# Task 3: Task Automation with Python Scripts

## Overview
This is **Task 3** of the Internship project series. This project demonstrates three real-life task automation examples using Python. Each script automates a common repetitive task that occurs in everyday computing scenarios.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **os** - Operating system interface
- **shutil** - High-level file operations
- **re** - Regular expressions for pattern matching
- **requests** - HTTP requests for web scraping
- **file handling** - Reading, writing, and processing files
- **pathlib** - Modern path handling
- **datetime** - Date and time operations

2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

### Quick Start

```

This will present a menu where you can:
1. Test individual automation tasks
2. Run all tasks together
3. Install required packages
4. Check environment setup

## Individual Script Usage

### Move JPG Files
```python
from move_jpg_files import move_jpg_files

# Move files from source to destination
source = "path/to/source/folder"
destination = "path/to/destination/folder"
moved_count, errors = move_jpg_files(source, destination)

print(f"Moved {moved_count} files")
```

### Extract Emails
```python
from extract_emails import extract_emails_from_text, validate_emails

# Extract emails from a text file
input_file = "sample_document.txt"
emails, output_file = extract_emails_from_text(input_file)

# Validate the extracted emails
validation_results = validate_emails(emails)
print(f"Found {len(emails)} emails, {validation_results['total_valid']} valid")
```

### Scrape Webpage Title
```python
from scrape_webpage_title import scrape_webpage_title

# Scrape a single webpage
url = "https://example.com"
title, output_file, status_code = scrape_webpage_title(url)

if title:
    print(f"Title: {title}")
    print(f"Saved to: {output_file}")
```

## Sample Data

### Test Images
The project includes sample image files in `test_data/images/`:
- `photo1.jpg` - Sample photo
- `vacation.JPG` - Vacation picture (uppercase extension)
- `document_scan.jpeg` - Scanned document
- `profile_pic.JPEG` - Profile picture (uppercase JPEG)
- `readme.txt` - Non-image file (should be ignored)

### Sample Text with Emails
`test_data/sample_text_with_emails.txt` contains approximately 28 email addresses mixed within various text content, including:
- Business emails (contact@company.com)
- Personal emails (john.doe@gmail.com)
- Special format emails (alice+billing@finance.co.uk)
- International domains (.org, .eu, .co.uk)

## Error Handling

All scripts include comprehensive error handling for:
- File not found errors
- Network connection issues
- Permission errors
- Invalid file formats
- Malformed URLs
- Encoding issues

## Customization

### Modifying File Patterns
To change which file types are moved in Task 1, edit the glob patterns in `move_jpg_files.py`:
```python
# Current patterns
jpg_files = list(source_path.glob("*.jpg")) + list(source_path.glob("*.JPG")) + \
           list(source_path.glob("*.jpeg")) + list(source_path.glob("*.JPEG"))

# Add more patterns
jpg_files += list(source_path.glob("*.png")) + list(source_path.glob("*.gif"))
```

### Modifying Email Regex
To change email detection patterns in Task 2, edit the regex in `extract_emails.py`:
```python
# Current pattern
email_pattern = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'

# More restrictive pattern
email_pattern = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,4}\b'
```

### Changing Target Websites
To change the websites scraped in Task 3, edit the URL list in `scrape_webpage_title.py`:
```python
test_urls = [
    "https://www.python.org",
    "https://github.com",
    "https://stackoverflow.com",
    "https://news.ycombinator.com"  # Add your own URLs
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Unicode/Encoding Errors on Windows:**
   - The demo script has been designed to work on Windows CMD/PowerShell
   - All Unicode characters have been removed for compatibility

2. **Requests Module Not Found:**
   - Install with: `pip install requests`
   - Or use the demo script's built-in installer (option 5)

3. **Permission Errors:**
   - Run with administrator privileges if moving files to protected directories
   - Ensure destination folders are writable

4. **Network Issues:**
   - Web scraping requires internet connection
   - Some websites may block automated requests
   - Try different URLs if specific sites fail

## Extensions and Improvements

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **GUI Interface:** Add a tkinter or PyQt interface
2. **Configuration Files:** Use JSON/YAML for settings
3. **Logging:** Add detailed logging with the logging module
4. **Parallel Processing:** Use threading for bulk operations
5. **Database Integration:** Store results in SQLite/PostgreSQL
6. **Cloud Integration:** Upload results to cloud storage
7. **Scheduling:** Add cron/Task Scheduler integration

### Advanced Features:
1. **Machine Learning:** Use ML to classify emails or images
2. **API Integration:** Send results to web APIs
3. **Real-time Monitoring:** Watch folders for new files
4. **Data Visualization:** Create charts from extraction results
